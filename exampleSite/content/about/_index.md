This theme is made for all those who want some fun geometrical elements in their page, but still have a feature rich site. 

The theme comes with 8 pre-defined colour schemas, and 5 different shapes for image previews of posts. In addition, custom colour schemas can be created either through the `hugo.toml` or by defining your own custom scss for colours and fonts.
